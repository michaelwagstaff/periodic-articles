# Periodic Articles

This is a collection of articles for the site periodicstats.com.

Please feel free to contribute, following the style shown in lithium.md. I am currently accepting articles written in english. Articles should be written in markdown and should follow the style guide.

If you are wanting to write an article please clone the repository and submit a pull request.

We welcome anyone new to using git, and I feel this project is a nice way to start with the open source community.

I am planning on adding options for translations and a place to submit images later.

Contributers will be fully credited for their work, although I cannot offer any monetary compensation
